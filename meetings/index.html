	    <p><i>13th-15th September 2017, Lausanne, Switzerland</i></p>
	    
	    <small><p>The goal of the CodeJam workshops is to catalyze open-source, collaborative software development in computational and systems neuroscience and neuroinformatics, by bringing together researchers, students and engineers to share ideas, present their work, and write code together.</p>
<p>The general format of the workshops is to dedicate the mornings to invited and contributed talks, leaving the afternoons free for discussions, tutorials and code sprints.</p>

            <h3><a href="Hippocamp2017/">HBP Hippocamp 2017: Collaborative and Integrative Modeling of Hippocampus</a></h3>
	    <p><i>23rd-24th May 2017, Paris, France</i></p>
	    
	    <small><p>Hippocampus, a brain area fundamental for learning and memory, is one of the most intensely studied brain areas world-wide. This means an enormous quantity of data, but also heterogeneity in terms of sources, methods, quality, etc. Integrating the available anatomical and physiological data in a unified model of hippocampus, and validating it broadly against known phenomena, is a challenging but feasible prospective given the HBP platforms roadmap.</p>
<p>In short, the aims of the workshop are two-fold. First, to engage the larger community of  experimentalists and modelers working on hippocampus, and highlight existing modeling efforts and strategic datasets for modeling the Hippocampus.  Second, to define and bootstrap an inclusive community-driven model and data-integration process to achieve open pre-competitive reference models of hippocampus, which are well documented, validated, and released at regular intervals (supported in part by IT infrastructure funded by HBP). Involvement from the community interested in characterization and modeling of hippocampus is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>The first day will be scientific presentations on modeling approaches, key datasets, problems and solutions, and some information on HBP activities relevant to the meeting. Instead of having regular research talks discussing the speaker's current research in detail, we aim to have shorter talks which either highlight important sources of experimental data (also discussing limitations etc.) or describe specific problems or solutions that are relevant to building a data-driven Hippocampus model. There will be ample time for discussion following talks. The second day will be highly interactive, and will have the objective of bootstraping a community process for planning, coordinating, reviewing, documenting, and validating regular releases of open integrative pre-competitive reference models of hippocampus.  For this format to be effective, the meeting size has been intentially limited.  There will be a poster session during lunches.</p>

            <h3><a href="CNS09/">CNS*09 Workshop: Python in Neuroscience</a></h3>
	    <p><i>22nd-23rd July 2009, Berlin, Germany</i></p>
	    
	    <small><p>Python is rapidly becoming the ''de facto'' standard language for systems integration. Python has a large
user and developer-base external to the neuroscience community, and a vast module library that facilitates
rapid and maintainable development of complex and intricate systems.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we highlighted efforts to develop Python modules for the domain of neuroscience software
and neuroinformatics. Moreover, we sought to provide a representative overview of existing mature Python
modules for neuroscience and neuroinformatics, to demonstrate a critical mass and show that Python is
an appropriate choice of interpreter interface for future neuroscience software development.</p>
<p>There was a tutorial+demo session where visitors with laptops could install and get introduced and
aquainted with the various Python software.</p>
<p>Many of these efforts have been featured recently in a special issue of Frontiers in Neuroinformatics on
&quot;Python in neuroscience &quot;.</p>

	    <p><i>5th-8th May 2008, Gif sur Yvette, France</i></p>
	    
	    <small><p>The first CodeJam focused on adding or improving Python support for different neuroscience simulators, and on the PyNN common simulator API. The focus for the second CodeJam was expanded to include the next stages in the simulation workflow - analysis and visualisation of simulation results, and management of simulation projects to promote reproducibility and reliability.</p>

            <h3><a href="CodeJam1/">FACETS CodeJam Workshop #1</a></h3>
	    <p><i>2nd-5th April 2007, Heidelberg, Germany</i></p>
	    
	    <small><p>Trends in programming language development and adoption point to Python as the high-level systems integration language of choice. Python leverages a vast developer-base external to the Neuroscience community, and promises leaps in simulation complexity and maintainability to any neural simulator which adopts it. As more and more simulators support Python, model development times can be drastically reduced by promoting code sharing and reuse across simulator communities. As a result, modelers can devote their software development time to innovating new simulation tools such as network topology databases, stimulus programming, analysis and visualization tools, and simulation accounting, to name a few. A multilateral effort to coordinate and organize these development efforts into a larger meta-simulator software system is a natural and alternate approach to incrementally address what is known as the <a class="reference external" href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/IEEE.Self-organization.pdf">complexity bottleneck</a>, presently a major roadblock for neural modeling. While a solution here is arguably a necessary condition for resolving the present stalemate for understanding the complexities of brain-like computing, a successful initiative could also end up being a major innovation of the field for the larger computing community.</p>
<p>The goal of the CodeJam meeting was to bring together the core group of developers and modelers presently working towards such a common set of meta-simulator tools implemented in Python. As there was much to discuss, the meeting was partly parallelized into &quot;Focus Groups&quot;. Code sprints were scheduled to address outstanding developer issues. A small number of technical talks were scheduled to promote discussion on recent innovations. We discussed how software already implemented can be improved and adopted, while trying to avoid arguing about specifications of unimplemented software, leaving this honor to the volunteer who risks to prototype it first. The focus of the meeting was on innovation, communication, convergence, multilateralism, and realization (from the german: Umsetzung).</p>
